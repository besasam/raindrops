# snowflakes

Tiny falling particles in JavaScript.

Demo [here](https://besasam.github.io/demos/snowflakes/).

~~After writing and testing this a bit I realized how insanely slow it would become for lots of particles, so this is pretty useless for now lol~~
Now powered by canvas. I'm learning, people.
